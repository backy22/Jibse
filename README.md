# Jibse üè†
Jibse helps tenants and owners make a worry-free lease contract without knowing each other.  
  
üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è As an owner,  
- I can post a place I want to rent out at any price and for any period I want using cryptocurrency.
- I can check the transaction histories of applicants to prevent fraud.
- I can easily check the payment status of current tenants.
  
üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è As a tenant,  
- I can ensure if the owner is a trustworthy person by reading reviews of rooms.
- I can pay a deposit and rent using cryptocurrency.
- I can get evidence on the network without having to write a separate contract.
- I can set up auto-payment.

# Inspiration ‚ö°Ô∏è
We are foreigners who have recently settled in Toronto. It was unnecessarily difficult for us to find a place to rent because of : 
- **Uncertain identity of owners** on existing platforms like Kijiji, Craigslist
- **Shortage of local currency holdings**
- **Lack of proofs to prove identities** such as credit scores, income, and reference in Canada

# What this platfrom offers
- **Transparency** and **reliability** of both owner and tenant by publishing all transactions into the Ethereum network
- **Convenience** and **practicality** by using cryptocurrencies especially paying a deposit from overseas before moving into a country
- **Equality** by giving the "ownership" of payment history to the user on Jibse to determine reliability instead of relying on bank credit score, income proof, reference, etc
